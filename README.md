# Kickstarting with Excel
##
## Overview of Project
### *Purpose*
#### The purpose of this analysis is to supply our client Louise with filtered and usable information to help her make informed discissions on crowd funding using the Kickstarter data. Using Excel, we supplied her with readable and searchable data, tables, and charts to help Louise with future decision making using past data for her crowd-sourcing project campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges 
### *Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date*
#### A Pivot Table (https://github.com/Chipsheffield/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater%20Outcomes%20By%20Launch%20Date%20Table%20.png) was created to look at Successful, Failed, and Canceled Outcomes by Month and then used to create the following Pivot Line Chart (https://github.com/Chipsheffield/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) to aid in Analysis of the Kickstater Campaign Data. 
#### 
### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*
#### A new sheet was created looking at the number of Successful, Failed, and Canceled Outcomes from the Kickstarter Campaign using the Goals data column (https://github.com/Chipsheffield/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcome%20Based%20On%20Goals%20Table.png). This sheet was used to create a new Pivot Chart that shows the Outcomes for the above based on Goal (https://github.com/Chipsheffield/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png). 
#### 
### *Challenges and Difficulties Encountered*
#### The biggest challenge for this module was trying to set the criteria and ranges for all the different formulas used, and insuring they worked across multiple pages. Given the shear size of this dataset, this was impossible to spot check and in the case of COUNTIFS had to be taken on faith. 
##
## Results 
### *What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*
#### That the best month to likely launch a Successful Theater Campaign is May or June, and the worst is in December. Also, the chance of launching a Canceled Theater Project is very low no matter the month. (https://github.com/Chipsheffield/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) 
####
### *What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?* 
#### That the percentage of Outcomes Canceled remains below 20% for the most part, but steadily increases as the Goal increases, which is the opposite of the percentage of the Successful Outcomes. Also, as Goal increases the percentage of Failed Projects increases while Successful Projects decrease.

####
### *What are some limitations of this dataset?* 
#### The size of this dataset is a major limitation. It was hard if not impossible to spot check the analysis data for many of the tables, charts, and graphs because Kickstarter in its final form contains 86,415 data cells. 
####
### *What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?* 
#### When creating charts based on percentages of total, we could have used Pie-Charts to give a quicker and more accurate description.
